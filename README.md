## Why Codewars?

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com) is an online platform that enables developers to improve their programming skills by solving coding challenges, referred to as 'kata'.

I’ve used Codewars to broaden my experience in solving programming problems, while focusing on writing efficient solutions and handling edge cases. After completing each kata, I review other users’ solutions to see alternative approaches, adding notes to the bottom of my solution on what I’ve learnt and how I could improve my own code.

## Folder Structure

My solutions are organised first by programming language and then by kata difficulty (increasing from 8 down to 1 kyu).
